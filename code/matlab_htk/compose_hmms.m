function hmm = compose_hmms(hmms, meta_hmm)
% hmm = compose_hmms(hmms, meta_hmm)
%
% Takes an array of HMM structures and a meta_hmm explaining how the
% HMMs in the list are stiched together and create one big FSM HMM
% from it.
%
% meta_hmm should have length(hmms) states.  Each state in meta_hmm
% should have a label corresponding to the name of one HMM in hmms.
% The state emissions of meta_hmm are ignored.  By default meta_hmm
% is fully connected.
